<h3>Debut
</h3>
<p>The Indian ODI team in the early 2000s saw Rahul Dravid as the wicket-keeper to ensure that the wicket-keeper spot didn't lack in batting talent and also tried other wicket-keeper/batsmen like Parthiv Patel and Dinesh Karthik.[36] With Dhoni performing well for the India A squad, he was picked in the ODI squad for the Bangladesh tour in December 2004.[37] Dhoni made his debut in the first match of the series and was run out for a duck.[38] Dhoni was picked for the subsequent ODI series against Pakistan.[39] In the second match of the series in Visakhapatnam, Dhoni playing in his fifth one-day international, scored 148 runs off 123 deliveries which surpassed the earlier record for the highest score by an Indian wicket-keeper.[40] Dhoni played in the Sri Lankan bilateral ODI series in October–November 2005 and was promoted to No. 3 in the batting order in the third ODI at Jaipur where he scored an unbeaten 183 runs off 145 balls, winning the game for India.[41] The innings would surpass his earlier record for the highest score by an Indian wicket-keeper and was described in Wisden Almanack as 'Uninhibited, yet anything but crude'.[42] It was also the highest individual score in ODI cricket in a run chase, a record which was broken seven years later by Shane Watson.[43][44] Dhoni ended the series with the highest aggregate of 346 runs and was awarded the Man of the series.[45]
